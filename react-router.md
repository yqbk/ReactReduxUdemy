# React-router

## History

Tiny JavaScript extra package that manages urls of the web browser.
- It watches URLs for changes
- It has ability to update it over time

## React-Router

Takes a new URL from history and updates react components.

### Types of history tracking
1. browserHistory - analyze the whole URL
2. hashHistory - analyze URL after `#` sign
3. memoryHistory - don't use URLs at all


### Example 
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Route, IndexRoute } from 'react-router';

import App from './components/app';

<Route path="/" component={ App }/>
```
google.com/  â‡’  renders App

### Nested route

When we have nested routes (here greeting inside the app)
```javascript
<Route path="/" component={ App }>
    <Route path="greet" component={Greeting}/>
  </Route>
```
child component (Greeting) is passed to parent component (App) as `this.props.children`


## Index route

Index route is used when no child matches the URL.

```javascript
  <Route path="/" component={App}>
    <IndexRoute component={PostsIndex}/>
    <Route path="greet" component={Greeting} />
  </Route>
```
